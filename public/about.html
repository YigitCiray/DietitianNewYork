                    <p class="intro-text">
                        As a registered dietitian serving New York, I help my clients achieve their health goals without giving up their favorite foods or social activities. My comprehensive nutrition programs are designed for sustainable, long-term success.

            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p class="story-text">
                I'm passionate about helping people discover that healthy eating doesn't mean deprivation or giving up the foods and experiences they love. Too often, nutrition gets wrapped up in restrictive diets and rigid rules that just don't work with real life.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                My approach is different. I combine evidence-based nutrition science with practical strategies that fit into your actual life. Whether you're navigating pregnancy, managing gestational diabetes, building strength, or just wanting to feel more energized, I work with you to create a plan that's personalized, sustainable, and actually enjoyable.
            </p>
            <p class="story-text">
                Located in New York, I serve clients both in-person and virtually, offering flexible support that works around your schedule. My 3-month and 6-month programs provide the structure and accountability needed for real transformation—without the stress of calorie counting or food elimination.

                    <h3>Evidence-Based</h3>
                    <p>Every recommendation I make is grounded in peer-reviewed research and established nutrition science. No fad diets or unproven claims—just reliable, evidence-based guidance.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="philosophy-card">
                    <h3>Personalized</h3>
                    <p>There's no one-size-fits-all approach to nutrition. I take the time to understand your unique needs, preferences, lifestyle, and goals to create a plan that's truly yours.</p>
