# Folate vs. Folic Acid: Understanding the Difference

If you're pregnant or trying to conceive, you've likely heard about the importance of folic acid. But did you know there's a difference between folate and folic acid? Understanding this distinction can help you make better choices for your prenatal nutrition.

## What's the Difference?

### Folate (Natural Form)
- **Folate** is the natural form of vitamin B9 found in foods
- It's found in leafy greens, legumes, citrus fruits, and fortified foods
- The body can use it directly once consumed

### Folic Acid (Synthetic Form)
- **Folic acid** is the synthetic (man-made) form of vitamin B9
- It's used in supplements and fortified foods
- The body must convert it to an active form before use

## Why Does This Matter?

Some people have a genetic variation (MTHFR mutation) that makes it harder to convert folic acid into its active form. For these individuals, consuming folate-rich foods or taking methylfolate (the active form) may be more beneficial.

## Best Food Sources of Folate

1. **Dark leafy greens** - Spinach, kale, collard greens
2. **Legumes** - Lentils, chickpeas, black beans
3. **Citrus fruits** - Oranges, grapefruit
4. **Avocado** - A delicious source of folate
5. **Fortified grains** - Many breads and cereals are fortified with folic acid

## Recommendations for Pregnancy

The recommended daily intake for pregnant women is **600 micrograms (mcg)** of folate/folic acid equivalents. This is typically achieved through:
- A balanced diet rich in folate-containing foods
- A prenatal vitamin containing folic acid or methylfolate

## The Takeaway

Both folate and folic acid are important for preventing neural tube defects in early pregnancy. Focus on eating a variety of folate-rich foods, and discuss your prenatal vitamin choice with your healthcare provider or registered dietitian.
