## FAQs

**Q: How is this different from other diet programs?**
A: I don't prescribe generic meal plans or follow rigid diets. Every recommendation is personalized to your specific needs, preferences, and lifestyle. You'll receive evidence-based guidance tailored to work with your real life, not against it.

**Q: Do I have to give up my favorite foods?**
A: Absolutely not! My approach is non-restrictive. We work together to include all foods in a balanced, healthy way. You won't get a list of "forbidden" foods.

**Q: How do the 3-month and 6-month programs work?**
A: Both programs include comprehensive assessment, weekly sessions, and ongoing support. The 6-month program provides extended time for deeper habit formation and long-term transformation.

**Q: Do you work with pregnant women?**
A: Yes! Pregnancy and maternal nutrition is one of my specialties. I help women navigate nutrition during pregnancy, manage gestational diabetes, and maintain healthy eating postpartum.

**Q: What if I don't have much time to cook?**
A: That's completely fine! A major part of my approach is meeting people where they are. We'll create strategies that work with your schedule—whether that means simple 15-minute meals, healthy convenience options, or gradual cooking skill building.

**Q: Do you provide meal plans?**
A: Yes, but they're personalized to YOUR preferences, cultural background, budget, and schedule. You won't receive generic meal plans that don't fit your life.

**Q: How quickly will I see results?**
A: This depends on your specific goals. Some clients notice increased energy within days. Body composition changes typically begin in 4-6 weeks. The timeline varies, and I'll set realistic expectations based on your unique situation.
